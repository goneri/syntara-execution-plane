# WorkerManager boundary

`WorkerManager` is the backend seam for obtaining a worker, invoking one
logical WorkItem, and releasing or returning the worker. Its public interface
does not require a Kubernetes Job or Pod:

```python
class WorkerManager(Protocol):
    async def dispatch(self, work_item: WorkItem) -> dict[str, Any]: ...
```

The worker process registers managers by `ExecutionTarget.backend_type`. The
first implementation is `VanillaK8sWorkerManager`; it reads the target's
namespace, selectors, and tolerations plus the cluster's verified endpoint,
CA, and credential. It builds no AO or Temporal dependency into EP.

## Cold-start implementation

The current manager allocates one single-attempt `batch/v1` Job for each
claim-generation attempt. The deterministic Job name, Job UID, logical WorkItem
ID, and claim generation are distinct identities. The backend verifies the
created Pod's Job owner UID before opening the gRPC port-forward. Invocation and
all application results use the SDK protocol; Kubernetes is used only to
provision, observe, and clean up resources.

The manager persists the terminal result and EP completion outbox before
deleting its exclusively owned Job. Cleanup state is recorded separately from
execution state. An aged NetworkPolicy reconciler removes policies left behind
after a controller crash only when both the Job and its Pods are gone.

## WorkItem lifecycle and recovery

EP's WorkItem and attempt lifecycle remains authoritative if a Job disappears,
finishes, or cannot be cleaned up. Claims carry a database owner and generation;
long-running dispatch refreshes the lease, and every mutation checks the same
fence. A stale controller cannot update a newer attempt.

Known pre-Execute failures can be requeued after backoff. A gRPC failure after
Execute might have been submitted is recorded as `reconciliation_required`,
not automatically rerun. The current SDK runtime has no result replay query, so
a missing terminal frame may require operator investigation. See
[cold-start-node-dispatch.md](cold-start-node-dispatch.md) for the crash windows
and current limits.

Cancellation first reaches the node through its gRPC `Cancel` RPC. For the
exclusive cold-start allocation, EP may delete the Job to force termination and
reports cancellation only after the invocation is confirmed stopped. A terminal
result observed during the race wins. A manager for a shared/warm worker must
return or quarantine it; it must not delete the worker when one WorkItem ends.

## Current scheduler limits

`WorkStore.claim_one()` still assigns the first active, project-eligible default
target. The placement reconciler is constructed but is not yet used to rank or
select targets. There is no capacity reservation, warm pool, concurrent
dispatch, or WorkWatcher. One worker replica processes one item at a time for
the first release. These limits keep allocation ownership explicit while more
backends and clients are added in later releases.
